# DVA_265_LAB
This repository contains solutions to all lab exercises from the DVA-265 Artificial Intelligence 2 (AI2) course at MDU. The labs were completed using Prolog and Python, where applicable, demonstrating foundational concepts in logic programming, knowledge representation, and expert systems. In addition to the implementation of Evolutionary Algorithms and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS).
